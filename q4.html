            <b><u>One Piece</b></u> by The series focuses on <u>Monkey D. Luffy</u>—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a <u>Devil Fruit</u>—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named<u>Roronoa Zoro</u>, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; <u>Usopp</u>, a sniper and compulsive liar; and <u>Sanji</u> an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry[Jp 16]—later replaced by the Thousand Sunny[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea
